/*
	- SQLite has supported foreign key constraint since version 3.6.19. 
	The SQLite library must also be compiled with neither 
	SQLITE_OMIT_FOREIGN_KEY nor SQLITE_OMIT_TRIGGER.

	- To check whether your current version of SQLite supports foreign key 
	constraints or not, you use the following command.
		PRAGMA foreign_keys;
		
	- If the SQLite library is compiled with foreign key constraint support, 
	the application can use the PRAGMA foreign_keys command to enable or 
	disable foreign key constraints at runtime.
	- To disable foreign key constraint:
		PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;
	- To enable foreign key constraint:
		PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

-- Letâ€™s start with two tables: suppliers and supplier_groups :
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
	supplier_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
	supplier_name text NOT NULL,
	group_id integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE supplier_groups (
	group_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
	group_name text NOT NULL
);

/*
	- Assuming that each supplier belongs to one and only one supplier group. 
	And each supplier group may have zero or many suppliers. The relationship 
	between supplier_groups and suppliers tables is one-to-many. In other 
	words, for each row in the suppliers table, there is a corresponding row 
	in the supplier_groups table.
	- Currently, there is no way to prevent you from adding a row to the 
	suppliers table without a corresponding row in the supplier_groups table.
	- In addition, you may remove a row in the supplier_groups table without 
	deleting or updating the corresponding rows in the suppliers table. This 
	may leave orphaned rows in the suppliers table.
	- To enforce the relationship between rows in the suppliers and 
	supplier_groups table, you use the foreign key constraints.
*/

-- "supplier_groups" is one, when "suppliers" is many
-- To add the foreign key constraint to the suppliers table, you change 
-- the definition of the  CREATE TABLE statement above as follows:
DROP TABLE suppliers;
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    supplier_id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    supplier_name TEXT    NOT NULL,
    group_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id)
       REFERENCES supplier_groups (group_id) 
);
/*
	- The supplier_groups table is called a parent table, which is the 
	table that a foreign key references. The suppliers table is known 
	as a child table, which is the table to which the foreign key 
	constraint applies.
	- The group_id column in the supplier_groups table is called the 
	parent key, which is a column or a set of columns in the parent 
	table that the foreign key constraint references. Typically, the 
	parent key is the primary key of the parent table.
	- The group_id column in the suppliers table is called the child 
	key. Generally, the child key references to the primary key of 
	the parent table.

-- First, insert three rows into the supplier_groups table.
INSERT INTO supplier_groups (group_name) VALUES
   ('Domestic'),
   ('Global'),
   ('One-Time');

-- Second, insert a new supplier into the suppliers table with 
-- the supplier group that exists in the supplier_groups table.
INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, group_id)
VALUES ('HP', 2);

-- Third, attempt to insert a new supplier into the suppliers table 
-- with the supplier group that does not exist in the supplier_groups table.
INSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_name, group_id)
VALUES('ABC Inc.', 4);

SELECT * FROM suppliers;
